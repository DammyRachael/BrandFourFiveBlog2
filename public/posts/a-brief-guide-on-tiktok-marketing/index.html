<h2 id="a-brief-guide-on-tiktok-marketing">A brief guide on TikTok marketing.</h2>

<p>At a time when building a community is most important, TikTok has shown itself as a perfect place to increase your brand awareness. TikTok has over <strong><em>800 million monthly active users and an average view time of 52 minutes</em></strong>, which gives your brand enough show time.
TikTok is the first video sharing network that appeal to GenZ users, which is best known for viral dance trends, challenges and lip-sync videos. This platform stands as a triple threat against Instagram and other social media platforms – combining video creation, entertainment driven social network and one touch syndication network.
You are about to discover all you can do with TikTok; from the best time to post, trendy contents, algorithm and a bonus tip – <em>you have to read to the end to know what it is</em>.</p>

<p><strong>TikTok is here to stay, why?</strong></p>

<p>With the TikTok app, the creator in you is explored. TikTok has special features that allows you to shoot footage, trim videos, stitch clips together and incorporate music into your videos. You do not need to be an expert; you just need to think outside the box and utilize the daily challenges and other users’ contents.</p>

<p>The TikTok’s home page is also designed to put viral videos first. However, you can visit the discover page to find plethora of prompts and challenges.</p>

<p>You can also share your videos to other platforms like Instagram with one click, which can contribute to your platform’s organic growth.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best kind of content for TikTok?</strong></p>

<p>TikTok is popular for huge culture trend. The best contents are those easy to replicate or a spin-off of a trend. For instance, the #tooslide trend has over 2.2M TikTok videos including Justin Bieber and Jason Derulo.</p>

<p>However, if you thought TikTok was all about dance challenges, you are wrong, it has space for lip sync, fashion and beauty transitions, fitness workouts, comedy, camera hacks, etc.</p>

<p><em>PRO TIP: discover your brand’s USP (unique selling point), then based your content on this sweet spot</em>.</p>

<p><strong>When is the best time to post?</strong></p>

<p>TikTok is a buzzing place, yet experiencing several stages of evolution, hence discovering the best time to post may seem mysterious. However, if you discover the best time to post, this is less competition and more engagements.</p>

<p>An easy way to find out is to create a Pro account. How?</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the “manage my account” section by tapping the three dots at the right corner of your profile page</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select “switch to Pro account”</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose your business industry</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Your TikTok account will reload as a pro account with the analytics section</p>

<p><em>PRO TIP: to have a good overview of your followers, you need a spreadsheet, as the app only records the last 28 days</em>.</p>

<p>Now, just like many social platforms, you need to monitor;
1.  The location of your audience; For instance, if majority of your audience is in Lagos, your best time would between mid-day and evenings – too early or too late is never a good time.
2.  Your follower’s activity, what time were they most engaging?
3.  Your content performance; though this may be stressful, you still need to do it properly, it is a good way to have a head-start of when to post</p>

<p><em>PRO TIP; the TikTok analytics does not incorporate the time zone of any location or integrate countries. So, determine the best time to post, you need to consider the time zones of various locations, to determine the best time to post</em>.</p>

<p><strong>How does TikTok algorithm works?</strong></p>

<p>The TikTok platform is still evolving, so pinning the algorithm down may be difficult as the features and trends are constantly changing. However, to win the TikTok lottery, you want to aim to hit the “For You” page of any user, here are 5 most important factors that can help you get there;
1.  Hashtags: though knowing the exact hashtags to use can be really tedious, however, you can check the discover page to see trending hashtags or type out hashtags and watch out for those with the fire icon.
<em>PRO TIP: research trending hashtags and see if you can take part in such challenge</em>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Captions: TikTok doesn’t allow long captions like Instagram, the ideal caption on TikTok is short and easy.
PRO TIP: ensure your captions are engaging, ask questions, make a joke, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Trending songs or sound: TikTok is a video sharing platform, so you need your videos to have captivating or viral sound or song.
<em>PRO TIP: you can discover sounds or songs from trending sound option in the video editor or the favourite section or followers’ playlists</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Most active time; like we explained earlier, monitor the most active time of your audience and utilize that time.</p></li>

<li><p>The last factor is YOU. TikTok has several features like duets, new filters, features, video time, etc. you just need to utilize them and do it consistently.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How do you grow your followers on TikTok?</strong></p>

<p>Though TikTok doesn’t need you to have several followers before you hit the “For You” page, however, you want to gain large following to increase your brand awareness. These are few tips to take note;</p>

<ol>
<li>Identify your target audience – this cannot be overemphasized. There are 800 million monthly active users, they can’t all be your audience, so you need to know who you want to attract. When you do this, it will influence your content and your time of posting.
<em>PRO TIP; to discover all of these, you need the Pro account. It is your best bet to discovering your followers</em>.</li>
<li>Hit the trend; don’t let trends slide away, utilize the challenges, get creative!</li>
<li>Create your own trend or challenge; if you do not seem to like the current trend, you can create yours. Famous performers like Jenifer Lopez, as well as brands like Chipotle, with the #chipotlelidflip challenge that currently has over 300m views.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to be creative. Try out several contents at various times, and soon enough, you will understand what works best for you.</li>
<li>Connect to other platforms. With TikTok one touch syndication, you share on other platforms.</li>
</ol>
