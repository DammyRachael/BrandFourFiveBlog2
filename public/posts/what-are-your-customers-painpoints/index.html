<h2 id="what-are-my-customers-39-pain-points-one-crucial-question-every-business-leader-must-ask">What are my customers&#39; pain points? One crucial question every business leader must ask.</h2>

<p>You probably think that you have your customers&#39; challenges all figured out. But what you have failed to consider is that your customers need different solutions for different problems per time; they probably
want you to solve problem A, right now and not problem C.</p>

<p>Your customers&#39; pain points are the challenges they experience, which is an opportunity for your business
to make better solutions. We are going to give you 5 ways to identify and monitor these pain points.</p>

<ol>
<li><h4 id="reassess-your-buyer-personas">Reassess your buyer personas</h4>

<p>A buyer persona is usually the first thing you do when you want to start a business. 
However, as you make more sales and interact with your customers, their needs begin to modify as they begin to seek better ways to get their problems solved – and you are that problem solver, you must be ahead of them.</p>

<p>Per time, you must be able to reassess your audience story; What has their engagement been like? What kind of audience have you garnered over time? What were their reactions to your new product or service?
Is there a consistent interest or demand? Etc.</p></li>

<li><h4 id="ask-your-customers">Ask your customers</h4>

<p>The best people to ask about their needs is your customers. There are plenty of ways to do this; you can make a survey or opinion poll on social media. Ask them what they want to get from you, or what their pain points are. </p>

<p>Simple questions you can ask are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What were you trying to solve when you came across our product/service?</li>
<li>Is our product/service solving your problems or we need to improve?</li>
<li>What other kinds of customers would benefit from our product or service?</li>
<li>Would you rather have an alternative to our product/service, or we are perfect?</li>
<li>Would it be difficult for you to find an alternative if we stop existing? Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can’t underestimate what these questions mean to your customers, the more they feel you are interested in their challenges, the more engagements you would get.</p></li>

<li><h4 id="listen-to-them-on-social-networks">Listen to them on social networks</h4>

<p>Business leaders have accepted social media as a way to reach their customers and build thought leadership relationship.</p>

<p>You can leverage social groups like LinkedIn groups, Twitter or Facebook; to identify customers&#39; trends and opinions about your product or industry. </p></li>

<li><h4 id="ask-your-customers-39-first-contact-the-sales-team">Ask your customers&#39; first contact – the sales team</h4>

<p>Your sales team are the go-to resource in your business. They consistently make daily contact with your customers – existing, new and lost customers.
Hence, you must schedule meetings regularly with your sales team; to get their observations, comments and suggestions. Simple questions to ask them are: </p>

<ul>
<li>What were the pain points put forward by customers/prospects?</li>
<li>Why did some customers/prospects turn down our products?</li>
<li>What do customers/prospects like or dislike about our products?</li>
</ul></li>

<li><h4 id="pay-attention-to-your-competitors">Pay attention to your competitors.</h4>

<p>After you must have surveyed your customers and sales team, listen on social media and reassess your personas. You must also observe your competitors&#39; approach. 
An easy way to do this is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check their websites, especially their pricing and FAQs. Identify what you missed and what customers are saying about them. </li>
<li>Search and observe their ads copies. What pain points did they address? </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Conclusion 
Discovering your customers&#39; pain points is no easy task and technology trends, do not make it any lesser.
However, if you consider these five rules, you will target the right people and give your existing customers, more reasons to do business with you.</p>
